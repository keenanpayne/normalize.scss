Normalize.scss
==============

This is an SCSS port of Nicolas Gallagher's [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/) that I originally used in my front-end framework [Concise](http://github.com/ConciseCSS/concise.css). This port comes in two forms: an all-inclusive file (`_normalize.scss` in the root folder) as well as an abstracted set of files (found in the `abstracted` folder).

Quickstart
==============

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/keenanpayne/normalize.scss/archive/master.zip)

2. Include in your SASS project via `@import` or compile and include in your HTML file (`<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="normalize.css" />`)

LESS Version
==============

I have ported this code to [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) so if you prefer that as your preprocessor, check out the repo here: [https://github.com/keenanpayne/normalize.less](https://github.com/keenanpayne/normalize.less).

Acknowledgements
==============

Normalize was originally created by [Nicolas Gallagher](https://github.com/necolas) and [Jonathan Neal](https://github.com/jonathantneal), so big thanks to them for the great tool!
